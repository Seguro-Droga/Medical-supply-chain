# Medical-supply-chain

This diagram represents the overall structure of Secura Droga where the chain of contracts can be created till the top of the supply chain and the contract will be fulfilled and updated accordingly. First, Retailer creates a contract with a distributor, say D1, with the quantity, medicine-ID, price, seller and buyer. This contract is received by the distributor D1 who in turn creates a contract with Manufacturer say Anglo (M1), with the same parameters, the difference being in the seller and buyer. Now the manufacturer produces the medicine and transfers the ownership to distributor D1. D1 now completes the supply chain by giving the ownership of the medicine to the pharmacist i.e Apollo and thus fulfilling and updating the status of the contract. Retailer(Pharmacist) has coupled RFID with a desktop setup that detects whether a drug is counterfeit/un-authentic or not, by considering filters issued by the android app in user end.
